# Lifecycle hooks
Every Angular component goes through the process of creation, then Angular goes on to execute all the functions it was created to execute and then go to possible destruction, this is called the lifecycle of a component. Angular does this by creating the component, rendering it as well as creating and rendering all its children. Then Angular checks for changes in the data properties or in the DOM, and makes the appropriate updates and finally when it is done, destroys it then removes it from the DOM.

Angular offers lifecycle hooks that provide visibility into these key life moments and the ability to act when they occur.

There are eight lifecycle hooks in Angular:

* ngOnChanges()
* ngOnInit()
* ngDoCheck()
* ngAfterContentInit()
* ngAfterContentChecked()
* ngAfterViewInit()
* ngAfterViewChecked()
* ngOnDestroy()
